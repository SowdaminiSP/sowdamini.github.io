    "text": "Hi, I’m Sowdamini. I’m a PhD candidate at the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies, University of Tasmania. My research—supervised by Prof. Julia Blanchard, Prof. Chris Carter, and Prof. Duncan Cameron (University of Manchester)—explores the environmental impacts of aquaculture and fisheries growth, and the trade-offs these pose for sustainable food systems.\nI’m driven by a core question: What does sustainability in food systems truly mean? I investigate how different sustainability metrics are applied—and sometimes misapplied—to label food sources as “sustainable” without fully accounting for context, equity, or global diversity.\nMy personal motivation stems from the observation that large-scale studies from the global North often make sweeping generalisations that overlook the realities of food production and needs in the global South. I’m passionate about interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to complex global challenges, and I advocate for the inclusion of diverse, non-Western knowledge systems in sustainability and resource governance."
