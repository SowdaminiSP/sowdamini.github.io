    "text": "Hi, I am Sowdamini. I am a PhD candidate based at the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies, University of Tasmania. I work with Prof Julia Blanchard, Prof Chris Carter and Prof Duncan Cameron (University of Manchester) to ascertain the impacts of aquaculture and fisheries growth on the environment and associated food system tradeoffs.\nI want to understand what sustainable food truly means and how different sustainability metrics are used to promote a food systems as a “sustainable” sources of food to feed the population..\nSome questions I hope to answer through my PhD are..\nIs fish really more sustainable than terrestrial meat? What do we even mean by sustainability here? Is it easier to produce or catch, is it associated with lower carbon footprint when traded?\nMy personal motivation lies in the fact that the global west and north make large-scale studies and assumptions about the whole world without fully recognising the differences and diversity of third world countries’ food production and needs..\nI am passionate about interdisciplinary and trans disciplinary approach to global problems and an advocate for highlighting non-western sustainability and resource management practices."
